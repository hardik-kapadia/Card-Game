# Card-Game

MS Hearts the classic card game in the terminal format.
The Basic games of the rules are:
1. there are 4 plyers, each with thirteen cards.
2. The first player starts playing by laying down the any card (The actual game rules dictate that the person with the 2 of clubs plays   first and is to play that card only, I'll integrate that rule soon).
3. All the players play a card the one with the highest takes home the hand. (Symbol rules apply)
4. If the hand contains a any card of hearts, a point will be awarded to the winner of the hand.
5. If the hand contains a queen of spades, 13 points will be awarded to the winner of the hand.
6. If a player gets all the cards of heart and the queen of spades, everyone but that person will be awarded 26 points.
7. The player with the lowest number of points wins!
